Offsetof is a tool (and Python library) for finding field offsets in C structs.

It works for both userspace- and Linux kernel headers - though you do need to
explicitly tell it which one you want.

Currently there isn't any API documentation for the library part. (But really,
you just need to call a single function to use it, so just take a look at main()
and you'll be fine)

[As with most software, do NOT use this with untrusted input]

Requirements:
- A C compiler

Recommended:
- pyelftools

For the kernel functionality, you will also need:
- The source for your kernel
- make
- pyelftools (or objdump and objcopy)

Usage:
  $ offsetof [--kernel] HEADER|ELF STRUCT [FIELD]...

Examples:

  $ offsetof time.h "struct timespec" tv_sec tv_nsec
  $ offsetof --kernel linux/blkdev.h "struct request" rq_disk cmd_flags

If pyelftools is installed, you can also automatically print all fields in a struct,
or give an executable (ELF with DWARF debugging information) in place of the header:

  $ offsetof time.h "struct timespec"
  $ offsetof --kernel linux/blkdev.h "struct request"
  $ offsetof bin/my_executable "struct request"
